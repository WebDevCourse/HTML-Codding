    The purpose of this page is to progressively list the resources useful when working on W3C projects using GitHub.
    The following links should help you find your way. Refer to the FAQ for details about the breadth and scope of W3C
    projects.

    <dt>Repositories</dt>
    <dd>If you are looking for a specific project that we maintain on GitHub, the best is to go straight to the list of
        repositories, which is searchable.
    </dd>
    <dt>GitHub Help</dt>
    <dd>Most of the issues people have using GitHub are in fact due to git. General git and GitHub questions will not be
        addressed here. GitHub's own help site linked above is a very helpful resource. You can also usually just cut
        and
        paste from Stack Overflow's git questions. Eric Eggert conducted a training session about Git and GitHub (1h40′
        video + slides).

    <dt>FAQ</dt>
    <dd>Introductory-level questions that are commonly asked about using GitHub specifically in a W3C context.
        Using GitHub for Spec Work
        A step-by-step guide to get up and running with a specification on GitHub, from Tobie.
        Contributor Management
        If your group accepts contributions from a broad set of people through pull requests, this tool can help you
        make
        sure that the contributors have signed the requisite IPR agreements.
        Automatic Publication from GitHub
        In general, it is strongly recommended to use Echidna to publish TR documents rather than the manual path that
        goes
        through the Webmaster (assuming of course that your document is of a supported type). This document explains how
        to
        set up your repository using Travis CI in order to automatically publish on every commit (to a given branch) and
        never again have to worry about what people used to call “heartbeat” publications. With this, you can even get
        rid
        of the notion of Editor's Draft altogether.
        Keeping Track with Midgard
        One problem is GitHub is that everything happens in spread out repositories, which can at times make it
        difficult to
        remain informed of what's going on. Midgard helps there by filtering the data into mailboxes so that you can for
        instance get all the events for WebRTC repositories. Log in there with your W3C credentials, and just start
        using
        it. Note: it does not at this time have many filters and it is likely that your area of interest may not yet
        have
        one. If you wish to add one (which is easy) you should read the documentation on Pheme filters.
        The w3c.json file
        This is a small metadata file that is recommended for GitHub repositories under the w3c organisation.
